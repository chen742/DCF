# MIC for Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation

## Environment Setup

For this project, we used python 3.8.5. We recommend setting up a new virtual
environment:

```shell
python -m venv ~/venv/mic-seg
source ~/venv/mic-seg/bin/activate
```

In that environment, the requirements can be installed with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.7  # requires the other packages to be installed first
```

Further, please download the MiT weights from SegFormer using the
following script. If problems occur with the automatic download, please follow
the instructions for a manual download within the script.

```shell
sh tools/download_checkpoints.sh
```

## Dataset Setup

**Cityscapes:** Please, download leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip and
gt_trainvaltest.zip from [here](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/)
and extract them to `data/cityscapes`.

**GTA:** Please, download all image and label packages from
[here](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/) and extract
them to `data/gta`.

**Synthia (Optional):** Please, download SYNTHIA-RAND-CITYSCAPES from
[here](http://synthia-dataset.net/downloads/) and extract it to `data/synthia`.

**ACDC (Optional):** Please, download rgb_anon_trainvaltest.zip and
gt_trainval.zip from [here](https://acdc.vision.ee.ethz.ch/download) and
extract them to `data/acdc`. Further, please restructure the folders from
`condition/split/sequence/` to `split/` using the following commands:

```shell
rsync -a data/acdc/rgb_anon/*/train/*/* data/acdc/rgb_anon/train/
rsync -a data/acdc/rgb_anon/*/val/*/* data/acdc/rgb_anon/val/
rsync -a data/acdc/gt/*/train/*/*_labelTrainIds.png data/acdc/gt/train/
rsync -a data/acdc/gt/*/val/*/*_labelTrainIds.png data/acdc/gt/val/
```

**Dark Zurich (Optional):** Please, download the Dark_Zurich_train_anon.zip
and Dark_Zurich_val_anon.zip from
[here](https://www.trace.ethz.ch/publications/2019/GCMA_UIoU/) and extract it
to `data/dark_zurich`.

The final folder structure should look like this:

```none

│   ├── acdc (optional)
│   │   ├── gt
│   │   │   ├── train

```

**Data Preprocessing:** Finally, please run the following scripts to convert the label IDs to the
train IDs and to generate the class index for RCS:

```shell
python tools/convert_datasets/gta.py data/gta --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/cityscapes.py data/cityscapes --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/synthia.py data/synthia/ --nproc 8
```

## Training

For convenience, we provide an [annotated config file](configs/mic/gtaHR2csHR_mic_hrda.py)
of the final MIC(HRDA) on GTA→Cityscapes. A training job can be launched using:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --config configs/mic/gtaHR2csHR_mic_hrda.py
```

The logs and checkpoints are stored in `work_dirs/`.

For the other experiments in our paper, we use a script to automatically
generate and train the configs:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --exp <ID>
```

More information about the available experiments and their assigned IDs, can be
found in [experiments.py](experiments.py). The generated configs will be stored
in `configs/generated/`.

## Evaluation

A trained model can be evaluated using:

```shell
sh test.sh work_dirs/run_name/
```

The predictions are saved for inspection to
`work_dirs/run_name/preds`
and the mIoU of the model is printed to the console.

When training a model on Synthia→Cityscapes, please note that the
evaluation script calculates the mIoU for all 19 Cityscapes classes. However,
Synthia contains only labels for 16 of these classes. Therefore, it is a common
practice in UDA to report the mIoU for Synthia→Cityscapes only on these 16
classes. As the Iou for the 3 missing classes is 0, you can do the conversion
`mIoU16 = mIoU19 * 19 / 16`.

The results for Cityscapes→ACDC and Cityscapes→DarkZurich are reported on
the test split of the target dataset. To generate the predictions for the test
set, please run:

```shell
python -m tools.test path/to/config_file path/to/checkpoint_file --test-set --format-only --eval-option imgfile_prefix=labelTrainIds to_label_id=False
```

The predictions can be submitted to the public evaluation server of the
respective dataset to obtain the test score.

## Checkpoints

Below, we provide checkpoints of MIC(HRDA) for the different benchmarks.
As the results in the paper are provided as the mean over three random
seeds, we provide the checkpoint with the median validation performance here.

* [MIC(HRDA) for Synthia→Cityscapes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Ed0Z2APrhIdsuQTOWXNlZwJJ9Yr2-Vu/view?usp=sharing)
* [MIC(HRDA) for Cityscapes→ACDC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10RNOAyUY5nYKzIIbNTie458r9etzfvtc/view?usp=share_link)
* [MIC(HRDA) for Cityscapes→DarkZurich](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXIwLULUsspBG4U1UAd7OQnDq1G33aTA/view?usp=sharing)

The checkpoints come with the training logs. Please note that:

* The logs provide the mIoU for 19 classes. For Synthia→Cityscapes, it is
  necessary to convert the mIoU to the 16 valid classes. Please, read the
  section above for converting the mIoU.
* The logs provide the mIoU on the validation set. For Cityscapes→ACDC and
  Cityscapes→DarkZurich the results reported in the paper are calculated on the
  test split. For DarkZurich, the performance significantly differs between
  validation and test split. Please, read the section above on how to obtain
  the test mIoU.
